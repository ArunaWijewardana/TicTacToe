 ## How I created this
 * I used our picogram project model. Created all the pages accordingly and created additional content as the Game files. Used the same structure as picogram.
 * The main programming which I did from the scratch can be found in /componenets/game.jsx
 * The logics are running on basic functianal levels. There are many improvements to be done. But depending on the time frame, this is the submittion for now.
